# @panneau/protocol

## 5.0.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- 88a3d09: Fields check their value with the backend, and the slug field does what sites' `PageSlug` did (decision 0032). A field with `check: true` sends `POST /resources/{resource}/fields/{field}/check` as it is typed (`FieldCheckRequest`), and the backend answers whether the value is available, a free suggestion, the URL's `prefix` and `url`, and `disabled` for an item the field doesn't apply to (`FieldCheckResponse`). The mock backend answers it, and the conformance kit checks it (`fields.check`). `DataAdapter.checkField?()` sends it; `createFieldCheckSource(adapter, resource, id)` gives the fields context its `checkSource`, which `FormView` takes too. The `slug` field follows its source in its own locale, or in the default one, shows the backend's URL, and offers the suggestion when the slug is taken. Field entries get the `locale` of the value they edit.
- b86f35e: A "Go to…" command palette ([decision 0029](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0029-go-to-palette.md)), which products can also use without the app:
  
  - `@panneau/ui`:
      - `CommandPalette`: a search field over groups of items to go to or run, in a dialog near the top of the screen (the whole screen on a phone).
      - It matches items without case or accents, needs every word to match, and ranks the best matches first (`matchCommands()`, `normalizeSearch()`). Groups that are already `matched`, such as results of a server, are shown as they are, after the others.
      - `useCommandShortcut()` opens it with ⌘K or Ctrl+K, unless something already handled the key.
      - Tokens: `--panneau-command-palette-*`.
  - `@panneau/core`: plugins add `commands` (`Command`, `getCommands()`). `isSearchable()` and `getSearchableResources()` tell which resources the global search covers: `features.search`, which defaults to `list.search`.
  - `@panneau/data`: `useSearch()`, `searchQueryOptions()` and `queryKeys.search()`.
  - `@panneau/protocol`:
      - resources get `itemSubtitle` and `itemImage`, next to `itemTitle`;
      - `features.search` defaults to `list.search`;
      - the mock backend answers `GET /search`: 5 items per resource, 20 in all, from 2 characters.
  - `@panneau/app`: "Go to…" in the sidebar (an icon when collapsed), in the phone's top bar, and on ⌘K or Ctrl+K.
      - It lists recent items, kept in the browser, then the navigation, "New {resource}", the commands of plugins and the app's actions.
      - The server's search results follow, grouped by resource, with their subtitle and image.
      - An item opens its edit form.
  - `@panneau/intl`: the messages of the palette, in English and French.
- 81ec6b2: The protocol of the image editor and the `image` field (decision 0031):
  
  - **`image` fields**, a built-in type: `media` fields for images, with the editor's options `ratios` (suggested), `rotate`, `focalPoint` and `transformBase` (`media`, `original` or `choose`). `lintDefinition()` checks their libraries as for `media`, and the mock backend references their images.
  - **The `crop` portable rule:** `{ "rule": "crop", "value": { "ratios": ["16:9", "1:1"], "required": true } }`. It requires a crop for each image, and one of the ratios once rendered, within one pixel. `checkRules()` and `checkValues()` check it, and `@panneau/forms` words it ("Crop the image to 16:9 or 1:1.") in English and French.
  - **`MediaTransform`** says its `base`: from the original file (the default), or over the media's own transform (`"media"`), with `baseTransform`, the media's transform it was made on. It keeps the keys that editor tools add.
  - **`MediaInfo.transform`:** the media's own transform. The mock backend gives it from the library's `transform` field.
  - **`parseRatio()`, `matchesRatio()` and `renderedCropSize()`** in `@panneau/protocol/runtime`.
- 6d1f1d8: Previews of items, in the panel of the show route ([decisions 0009 and 0028](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0028-item-panel.md)):
  
  - `@panneau/core`: plugins register preview components by name in `previews`, for resources whose `features.preview` is `{ "mode": "component", "component": "<name>" }`. They get `PreviewProps`: the item, its resource and the locale, to render the page as the site shows it, blocks, partials or charts.
  - `@panneau/data`: `previewItem()`, optional on adapters and implemented by the REST adapter, posts values to `POST /resources/{resource}/{id}/preview` and returns the short-lived URL of the item's page. `useItemPreview()`, `itemPreviewQueryOptions()` and `queryKeys.itemPreview()` fetch it.
  - `@panneau/protocol`: the mock backend answers the preview route, with a `data:` page of the item's values, or the URL of its `previewUrl` option.
  - `@panneau/app`: the panel of an item opens on a Preview tab, before its Details, when its resource has a preview, and remembers the tab. A button widens the panel, for previews (`--panneau-item-panel-width-wide`, half of the page by default).
  - `@panneau/intl`: the messages of previews, in English and French.
- 8372b27: A `media` field can allow several libraries (decision 0027). Its `resource` takes a list of library ids, and without one it allows every library of the definition, instead of being an error when there are several. `MediaReference` gets `resource`, its library: ids are unique only within their library, so a field that allows several needs it in requests, and the mock backend refuses a media without it. `getMediaLibraries(definition, field)` (in `@panneau/protocol/runtime`) gives the libraries a field allows. `lintDefinition()` checks each listed id, and that a `relation` field names one resource. `getLibrary()` of `@panneau/media` takes a list too, and gives the first library: the field uploads to it, the references it makes carry their library, and it reads each media in its own library. The `relation` field ignores a list in `resource`.
- 5779047: The global search reads `limit` and `resources`, and can be narrowed to one resource ([decision 0030](../docs/decisions/0030-search-parameters-and-scope.md)):
  
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:**
      - `GET /search` takes `limit` (1 to 20, 5 by default) and `resources` (comma-separated searchable resources). An invalid parameter is a `422` problem keyed by parameter, and a backend may answer `429` with `Retry-After`.
      - `readSearchQuery()`, `toSearchQueryParams()`, `isSearchableResource()` and the `SEARCH_*` limits are in `@panneau/protocol/runtime`. The mock backend uses them, and `openapi.json` documents them.
      - `runConformance()` checks the search: `search`, `search.scope` and `search.invalid`.
  - **`@panneau/data`:** `adapter.search(q, { limit, resources })`, `useSearch(q, { limit, resources })` and `searchQueryOptions(adapter, q, { limit, resources })`. Search keys are now `['panneau', 'search', q, options]`. A `429` is a `RateLimitedError`, with `retryAfter` from `Retry-After` (`readRetryAfter()`).
  - **`@panneau/ui`:** `CommandPalette` takes a `scope`, shown as a chip before the field, and `onScopeRemove`, called by Backspace in the empty field or the chip's button. Items with `keepsOpen` don't close it. Without results, its list shows its `status`.
  - **`@panneau/core`:** `isSearchable()` uses the protocol's `isSearchableResource()`.
  - **`@panneau/app`:** "Search in" narrows "Go to…" to one resource, with 20 results. "See all N results" opens the list of a resource, searched, when it has more results than shown. Too many searches are said in the palette.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the messages of the scope, in English and French.
- 5b2f3ce: Small fixes to the interface, and a link to the user's profile:
  
  - **`@panneau/ui`:**
      - a text before or after the value of a `TextInput` (`prefix`, `suffix`) reads with it, without a gap: `/episodes/ete-a-montreal`, as in the slug field. Icons and other elements keep their space;
      - `DatePicker` with a time (`granularity` `hour`, `minute` or `second`): the calendar has a field for the time, and stays open after a day is picked (`shouldCloseOnSelect` defaults to `false`). The calendar is as wide as its content, its month buttons lose the divider of the field's button, and the space of `10/15/2026, 9:30 AM` is back;
      - the description of an option (`Select`, `ComboBox`, `Menu`) is smaller, under its label, and an option with one has more room (`--panneau-list-box-item-padding-y-described`).
  - **`@panneau/app`:**
      - on a small screen too, the page is on a panel inset from the edges, with rounded corners, as on a large one. The shell's `inset`, `panel-border`, `panel-radius` and `panel-shadow` tokens apply at every width;
      - the user in the sidebar links to their profile: their item in the resource of users, when the definition has it.
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:** `user.resource` names the resource of users. Without it, clients look for a resource `users`.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the labels of the profile link and of the calendar's time, in English and French.

## 5.0.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- b9852a0: Media libraries are resources (decision 0026). A resource of kind `media` (`Resource.kind`) has a `file` field and gives each item a read-only `media` (`MediaInfo`: type, mime, size, URLs, renditions, dimensions, duration, status). Every media operation is a resource operation: `POST /resources/{library}` with `{ file: { upload } }` makes a media, and the `/media` endpoints are removed, with the `Media`, `MediaResponse` and `MediaListResponse` schemas and the media methods of `DataAdapter` (`listMedia`, `getMedia`, `uploadMedia`, `updateMedia`, `deleteMedia`). A `media` field references media of a library (its `resource`, optional with a single library): its value is a `MediaReference` (`{ id, label, media, transform }`), and requests send ids or `{ id, transform }`. `lintDefinition()` checks both. The mock backend serves libraries. `MediaField` takes a `resource` and makes media with `create()` and reads them with `get()`; `isMedia()` and `toMedia()` become `toMediaReference()` and `toMediaReferences()`, with `getLibrary()`.
- ecc77a6: `MediaTransform` states how renderers read it, as agreed with `laravel-image` 2 and `laravel-mediatheque` 2: the crop is in whole pixels of the upright original image (integers, `x` and `y` from 0, `width` and `height` from 1), the rotation is clockwise, the edits apply in the order crop, rotate, flip, and the focal point is relative to the upright original, not to the crop. **Breaking:** a crop with fractional pixels is now invalid.
- db1f253: Direct uploads to storage, separate from media (decision 0025). The protocol specifies the `presigned` upload mode: `POST /uploads/sign` signs each request of Uppy 6's S3 client, and `POST /uploads/{upload}/complete` gives an upload (`Upload`), which values reference as `{ "upload": "upl_…" }` (`UploadReference`): a file field, an import, or `POST /media` in JSON to make it a media. `POST /media` in `multipart/form-data` keeps working. A new `file` field type holds files that belong to an item: items give a stored file (`StoredFile`: `name`, `url`, `mime`, `size`), and requests send `{ upload }` to replace it, the stored file to keep it, or `null` to remove it. Media have an optional `status` (`pending`, `processing`, `ready`, `failed`). The mock backend answers the upload routes and stores the uploads that `file` values reference, and the conformance kit checks them (`uploads.sign`). `@panneau/data/uploads` adds `createPresignedUploads()`, without importing Uppy, and `uploadMedia()` takes `{ upload }` as well as a file.

## 5.0.0-alpha.3

### Minor Changes

- 5a2ae0c: Dry runs of actions, so that a list can say how many items of a query selection ("Select all N items") an action will skip before the user confirms it. In the protocol, an action declares `dryRun`, and a request with `"dryRun": true` answers an action result without running anything; the mock backend answers them, and the conformance kit checks them (`action.dry-run`). `@panneau/actions` adds `useActionPreview()` and `previewAction()`, and `ListView` takes a `previewAction`: its confirmation shows that it is checking, then the backend's count, and runs at once when nothing is skipped and the action asks no confirmation.

### Patch Changes

- 3af252d: The OpenAPI document lists `400` for the action endpoint: a dry run of an action that doesn't declare `dryRun` answers it, as the mock backend does.

## 5.0.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- 5af1673: Densities (decision 0024, step 6). `PanneauRoot` takes `density`: `compact`, `comfortable`, `touch`, or `auto` (the default, as before: touch on touch screens). New density tokens `--panneau-control-padding-x` and `--panneau-row-padding-y`. The paddings of buttons, inputs, list box options and list tables now follow the density. Themes redefine each density in `densities`, and `bootstrapTheme` sets Bootstrap's control sizes for the comfortable density only. `@panneau/protocol` adds `densities` to the `Theme` schema and `density` to the definition's theme. Storybook has a density switcher.
- d5cd252: Typed, composable themes (decision 0024, step 3). `@panneau/ui` adds `defineTheme()`, which type-checks token names, builds on other themes with `extends` and reports unknown tokens, a `palette` for themes (`--panneau-palette-<name>`), `mergeThemes()`, `findUnknownTokens()`, `SEMANTIC_TOKENS` and `PanneauTokens` for a project's own tokens. `@panneau/protocol` adds the `Theme` schema, `theme.schema.json` and `mergeThemes()`, and `definition.theme` now carries a theme that extends themes of plugins by id. The `Theme` of `@panneau/core` plugins is now that of the protocol, and `resolveTheme()` merges the theme of a definition.
- 27a1e08: Typography roles and fonts in themes (decision 0024, step 4). `@panneau/ui` adds the font roles `--panneau-font-family-body`, `-heading` and `-display` (`--panneau-font-family` is now a deprecated alias of the body family), `--panneau-font-numeric`, the `Heading` component with its size tokens (1 to 4, `display-1`, `display-2`), `Text`, and an opt-in `Prose` container for rich content. Themes take `fonts`, font faces or hosted stylesheets, which `PanneauRoot` adds to the page once. `bootstrapTheme` now sets the body family. `@panneau/protocol` adds `fonts` to the `Theme` schema. Numbers in fields and lists use `--panneau-font-numeric`.

## 5.0.0-alpha.1

### Major Changes

- 83999da: Add `@panneau/protocol`, the contract between Panneau frontends and backends.

### Minor Changes

- 345e06c: Add the boot config, which a server writes in the page of the app (`<script type="application/json" id="panneau-boot">`): the `BootConfig` schema and type (`protocol`, `apiBaseUrl`, `basePath`, `locale`, an optional inlined `definition` and `loginUrl`), `validateBootConfig()`, `BOOT_CONFIG_ELEMENT_ID`, `createBootConfigJsonSchema()` and the generated `@panneau/protocol/boot.schema.json`.
- 632b700: Export `createExampleDefinition()` from `@panneau/protocol/mock`: the example definition of the protocol's tests (pages with localized titles, a status, a conditional publication date, an author and typed blocks, in tabs and a sidebar), for the tests and stories of frontends with `createMockBackend()`.
- 2565d67: Add `@panneau/protocol/runtime`: the constants of the protocol and the helpers that run in the browser (`checkValues()`, `checkRules()`, `evaluateCondition()`, `lintDefinition()`, `getValue()`, `isFilled()`, `isProblem()`, `toSearchParams()`, `fromSearchParams()`), without loading zod. The main entry point still exports everything. `isProblem()` no longer uses the `Problem` schema, and accepts the same values. `@panneau/core` and `@panneau/fields` import the helpers from there, so zod (about 360 KB of source) is no longer in the bundles of products that use the forms and lists.
- 61da236: Add the protocol schemas and their types, definition validation and lint, the portable rules, list query helpers, the generated JSON Schema and OpenAPI files, an in-memory mock backend and the conformance kit.
- b3c9d6c: Range filters (`date-range`) send their bounds as their own keys: `filter[published_at][from]=2026-01-01&filter[published_at][to]=2026-01-31`, both inclusive, with an open end left out. `FilterValue` can be a `FilterRange` (`{ from?, to? }`), which `toSearchParams()` and `fromSearchParams()` read and write, and the protocol adds `isFilterRange()` and `matchesFilterRange()`, the reference of how a backend reads the bounds. The mock backend filters by ranges, and the conformance kit checks that a backend reads the bounds of a resource's `date-range` filter. `@panneau/lists` sends a date range as a `FilterRange` instead of `[from, to]` with an empty string for an open end, and filters items in memory by ranges. `@panneau/core` drops an empty range from the query.

### Patch Changes

- 2401025: Keep recursive schemas typed in the published declarations: `Condition.all` and `any`, `Field.fields` and `types`, `BlockType.fields`, `LayoutNode.children` and `MenuItem.children` were typed as `Record<string, unknown>[]` instead of their own type.
- aa02ea8: Add a `@panneau/source` export condition that points to the sources, used by the other workspace packages in tests and typechecks. Published consumers are not affected.
