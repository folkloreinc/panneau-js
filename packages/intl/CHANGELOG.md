# @panneau/intl

## 5.0.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- bdb1173: A first app shell replaces the placeholder of `@panneau/app`, to try the Phase 2 shell on the v5 components:
  
  - **Layout:** a sidebar on the window's background and the page on a raised panel, like the vertical tabs of recent browsers. The sidebar collapses to a rail of icons (its button, or Ctrl+\ / ⌘+\), and the browser remembers it. Below the `lg` width of the root, a bar opens it as a drawer.
  - **Navigation:** the `main` menu of the definition (`resources`, `resource`, `page`, `link`, `separator`, `group`), or every resource and page without one, with the Lucide icons the definition names. Resources the user can't list are left out.
  - **Pages:** a home page with a card per resource, resource lists (`ListView`, with the query in the URL and actions run by `@panneau/actions`), create and edit forms (`Form`, with server errors, version conflicts and the unsaved changes guard), plugin pages, and a not found page.
  - **Theming:** the frame reads the `--panneau-shell-*` and `--panneau-sidebar-*` component tokens (exported as `shellTokens`, `sidebarTokens` and `appComponentTokens`), which `defineTheme()` accepts once `@panneau/app` is imported: the inset panel of the default, or a flat frame with the sidebar on a surface.
  - **Theme:** the app renders in `PanneauRoot`, with the theme of the definition and its plugins, and a light, dark or system color scheme the user picks in the sidebar.
  - `Panneau` and `createPanneauApp()` take an `iconLoader`, every Lucide icon by default.
  - `@panneau/intl` has the messages of the app (`appMessages`), in English and French.
- 88a3d09: Fields check their value with the backend, and the slug field does what sites' `PageSlug` did (decision 0032). A field with `check: true` sends `POST /resources/{resource}/fields/{field}/check` as it is typed (`FieldCheckRequest`), and the backend answers whether the value is available, a free suggestion, the URL's `prefix` and `url`, and `disabled` for an item the field doesn't apply to (`FieldCheckResponse`). The mock backend answers it, and the conformance kit checks it (`fields.check`). `DataAdapter.checkField?()` sends it; `createFieldCheckSource(adapter, resource, id)` gives the fields context its `checkSource`, which `FormView` takes too. The `slug` field follows its source in its own locale, or in the default one, shows the backend's URL, and offers the suggestion when the slug is taken. Field entries get the `locale` of the value they edit.
- b86f35e: A "Go to…" command palette ([decision 0029](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0029-go-to-palette.md)), which products can also use without the app:
  
  - `@panneau/ui`:
      - `CommandPalette`: a search field over groups of items to go to or run, in a dialog near the top of the screen (the whole screen on a phone).
      - It matches items without case or accents, needs every word to match, and ranks the best matches first (`matchCommands()`, `normalizeSearch()`). Groups that are already `matched`, such as results of a server, are shown as they are, after the others.
      - `useCommandShortcut()` opens it with ⌘K or Ctrl+K, unless something already handled the key.
      - Tokens: `--panneau-command-palette-*`.
  - `@panneau/core`: plugins add `commands` (`Command`, `getCommands()`). `isSearchable()` and `getSearchableResources()` tell which resources the global search covers: `features.search`, which defaults to `list.search`.
  - `@panneau/data`: `useSearch()`, `searchQueryOptions()` and `queryKeys.search()`.
  - `@panneau/protocol`:
      - resources get `itemSubtitle` and `itemImage`, next to `itemTitle`;
      - `features.search` defaults to `list.search`;
      - the mock backend answers `GET /search`: 5 items per resource, 20 in all, from 2 characters.
  - `@panneau/app`: "Go to…" in the sidebar (an icon when collapsed), in the phone's top bar, and on ⌘K or Ctrl+K.
      - It lists recent items, kept in the browser, then the navigation, "New {resource}", the commands of plugins and the app's actions.
      - The server's search results follow, grouped by resource, with their subtitle and image.
      - An item opens its edit form.
  - `@panneau/intl`: the messages of the palette, in English and French.
- eadfc08: `@panneau/media/editor`: the image editor (decision 0031). It edits a transform of an image, with the image as it will be rendered. `ImageEditor` fits in a page or a panel, and lays itself out for its own width. `ImageEditorDialog` opens it in a large dialog, and a full-screen sheet on phones.
  
  - **Tools:** crop (a frame with handles and thirds, ratios, and numbers), rotate (with flips) and focal point (with the automatic crops it gives), from `useImageEditorTools()`. A product adds its own, with a panel, an overlay and a `validate()`.
  - **The keyboard** moves and resizes the crop frame, and moves the focal point.
  - **The field's rules:** offered or enforced `ratios`, and a required crop, which the editor proposes around the focal point.
  - **The base of a transform for one use:** over the media's own transform by default, with `base` and `baseTransform`, or from the original file. When the media's transform changed, the crop is moved inside the new version, and the editor says so.
  
  The entry point loads neither `@panneau/data` nor `@panneau/core`. Its messages are in `@panneau/intl`, in English and French.
- f2c79b5: The `image` field (decision 0031). `ImageField` is a `media` field for images, with the image editor:
  
  - **Preview:** each image shows as it is rendered for this use, computed in the browser.
  - **Edit** opens the editor on its transform.
  - **Badges** say whether it is cropped, needs a crop, or was cropped over a version of the library that changed.
  - **Options:** `ratios` (offered or enforced), `cropRequired`, `rotate`, `focalPoint` and `transformBase`, shown next to the description.
  - **After a pick:** when a crop is required, the editor is the step right after the pick of one image.
  
  `mediaPlugin` now gives the `image` type too, and `MediaFieldEntry` reads its options and its `crop` rule (`getImageOptions()`). `MediaField` takes them as `image`. The image editor and the field share how an image is drawn. The mockups of the editor and the field are deleted.
- 81ec6b2: The protocol of the image editor and the `image` field (decision 0031):
  
  - **`image` fields**, a built-in type: `media` fields for images, with the editor's options `ratios` (suggested), `rotate`, `focalPoint` and `transformBase` (`media`, `original` or `choose`). `lintDefinition()` checks their libraries as for `media`, and the mock backend references their images.
  - **The `crop` portable rule:** `{ "rule": "crop", "value": { "ratios": ["16:9", "1:1"], "required": true } }`. It requires a crop for each image, and one of the ratios once rendered, within one pixel. `checkRules()` and `checkValues()` check it, and `@panneau/forms` words it ("Crop the image to 16:9 or 1:1.") in English and French.
  - **`MediaTransform`** says its `base`: from the original file (the default), or over the media's own transform (`"media"`), with `baseTransform`, the media's transform it was made on. It keeps the keys that editor tools add.
  - **`MediaInfo.transform`:** the media's own transform. The mock backend gives it from the library's `transform` field.
  - **`parseRatio()`, `matchesRatio()` and `renderedCropSize()`** in `@panneau/protocol/runtime`.
- 6d1f1d8: The show route of an item opens its details in a panel next to its list ([decision 0028](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0028-item-panel.md)), instead of the edit form:
  
  - `@panneau/app`: titles in a list link to the show route, with the list's query. The panel shows the item's values, a link to edit it, and the `link` actions of the resource that apply to it, such as its page on the site. Its button or Escape closes it, back to the list with its query. It sits beside the list from the `xl` width of the root, and over it below. Its tokens are `--panneau-item-panel-*` (`itemPanelTokens`).
  - `@panneau/lists`: `ItemDetails` shows the values of one item with the displays of the lists. `ListView` takes `currentItemId`, which marks the row of the item shown and makes the link of its title the current page. Layouts get `isCurrent`. A table keeps its title column readable in a narrow list, and scrolls instead.
  - `@panneau/intl`: the messages of the panel, in English and French.
- 6d1f1d8: Previews of items, in the panel of the show route ([decisions 0009 and 0028](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0028-item-panel.md)):
  
  - `@panneau/core`: plugins register preview components by name in `previews`, for resources whose `features.preview` is `{ "mode": "component", "component": "<name>" }`. They get `PreviewProps`: the item, its resource and the locale, to render the page as the site shows it, blocks, partials or charts.
  - `@panneau/data`: `previewItem()`, optional on adapters and implemented by the REST adapter, posts values to `POST /resources/{resource}/{id}/preview` and returns the short-lived URL of the item's page. `useItemPreview()`, `itemPreviewQueryOptions()` and `queryKeys.itemPreview()` fetch it.
  - `@panneau/protocol`: the mock backend answers the preview route, with a `data:` page of the item's values, or the URL of its `previewUrl` option.
  - `@panneau/app`: the panel of an item opens on a Preview tab, before its Details, when its resource has a preview, and remembers the tab. A button widens the panel, for previews (`--panneau-item-panel-width-wide`, half of the page by default).
  - `@panneau/intl`: the messages of previews, in English and French.
- 199a687: The `media` field opens the media picker: "Choose media" ("Add media" with `multiple`) browses the libraries given as `sources`, and the media picked replaces the field's media, or is added to its list. `MediaFieldEntry` gives the sources of every library the field allows, through the adapter of `DataAdapterProvider`. With the picker, the upload button reads "Upload a file" ("Upload files"). A media is now removed by its library and id, so that two libraries can have media with the same id. New messages in `@panneau/intl`: `chooseMedia`, `addMedia`, `uploadFile` and `uploadFiles`.
- fb33783: New `@panneau/media/picker` entry point (decision 0027): `MediaPicker`, a dialog to browse media libraries, upload to them and pick one media, or several with `multiple`, on `MediaSource`s that Panneau or a product implements. It has search, a type filter, sorts, the filters of the sources and of the opener (the opener's `filter` is locked), infinite scroll that keeps its place (across openings with `stateKey`), a selection across libraries, `accept` and `maxSize` that grey out what doesn't match, details that edit the fields of a media with `update()` and ask before losing changes, an Upload tab whose files become media of the library shown and are selected (`confirmOnUpload` confirms a single one at once), and follows media being processed. It returns references with their library. The entry point loads neither `@panneau/data` nor `@panneau/core`. `createResourceMediaSource(adapter, library)`, in `@panneau/media`, gives the source of a library resource. `@panneau/intl` gets the picker's messages, in English and French.
- 5779047: The global search reads `limit` and `resources`, and can be narrowed to one resource ([decision 0030](../docs/decisions/0030-search-parameters-and-scope.md)):
  
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:**
      - `GET /search` takes `limit` (1 to 20, 5 by default) and `resources` (comma-separated searchable resources). An invalid parameter is a `422` problem keyed by parameter, and a backend may answer `429` with `Retry-After`.
      - `readSearchQuery()`, `toSearchQueryParams()`, `isSearchableResource()` and the `SEARCH_*` limits are in `@panneau/protocol/runtime`. The mock backend uses them, and `openapi.json` documents them.
      - `runConformance()` checks the search: `search`, `search.scope` and `search.invalid`.
  - **`@panneau/data`:** `adapter.search(q, { limit, resources })`, `useSearch(q, { limit, resources })` and `searchQueryOptions(adapter, q, { limit, resources })`. Search keys are now `['panneau', 'search', q, options]`. A `429` is a `RateLimitedError`, with `retryAfter` from `Retry-After` (`readRetryAfter()`).
  - **`@panneau/ui`:** `CommandPalette` takes a `scope`, shown as a chip before the field, and `onScopeRemove`, called by Backspace in the empty field or the chip's button. Items with `keepsOpen` don't close it. Without results, its list shows its `status`.
  - **`@panneau/core`:** `isSearchable()` uses the protocol's `isSearchableResource()`.
  - **`@panneau/app`:** "Search in" narrows "Go to…" to one resource, with 20 results. "See all N results" opens the list of a resource, searched, when it has more results than shown. Too many searches are said in the palette.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the messages of the scope, in English and French.
- 5b2f3ce: Small fixes to the interface, and a link to the user's profile:
  
  - **`@panneau/ui`:**
      - a text before or after the value of a `TextInput` (`prefix`, `suffix`) reads with it, without a gap: `/episodes/ete-a-montreal`, as in the slug field. Icons and other elements keep their space;
      - `DatePicker` with a time (`granularity` `hour`, `minute` or `second`): the calendar has a field for the time, and stays open after a day is picked (`shouldCloseOnSelect` defaults to `false`). The calendar is as wide as its content, its month buttons lose the divider of the field's button, and the space of `10/15/2026, 9:30 AM` is back;
      - the description of an option (`Select`, `ComboBox`, `Menu`) is smaller, under its label, and an option with one has more room (`--panneau-list-box-item-padding-y-described`).
  - **`@panneau/app`:**
      - on a small screen too, the page is on a panel inset from the edges, with rounded corners, as on a large one. The shell's `inset`, `panel-border`, `panel-radius` and `panel-shadow` tokens apply at every width;
      - the user in the sidebar links to their profile: their item in the resource of users, when the definition has it.
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:** `user.resource` names the resource of users. Without it, clients look for a resource `users`.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the labels of the profile link and of the calendar's time, in English and French.

## 5.0.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- 3974fb5: Messages of the upload fields, in English and French: those of the file field and the upload list in `fieldsMessages` (`panneau.fields.*`), and those of the media field in a new `mediaMessages` (`panneau.media.*`).

## 5.0.0-alpha.3

### Minor Changes

- 5a2ae0c: Dry runs of actions, so that a list can say how many items of a query selection ("Select all N items") an action will skip before the user confirms it. In the protocol, an action declares `dryRun`, and a request with `"dryRun": true` answers an action result without running anything; the mock backend answers them, and the conformance kit checks them (`action.dry-run`). `@panneau/actions` adds `useActionPreview()` and `previewAction()`, and `ListView` takes a `previewAction`: its confirmation shows that it is checking, then the backend's count, and runs at once when nothing is skipped and the action asks no confirmation.

## 5.0.0-alpha.2

No changes in this release.

## 5.0.0-alpha.1

### Major Changes

- 8d1313a: Add `@panneau/intl`: the messages of `@panneau/ui`, `@panneau/fields` and `@panneau/forms` in one place. `withPanneauMessages(locale, messages)` merges the messages of every package for a locale with an app's (`fr-CA` falls back to `fr`), `getPanneauMessages(locale)` returns them, and `en`, `fr` and `panneauMessages` are the catalogs. It also exports the message descriptors (`uiMessages`, `fieldsMessages`, `formsMessages`), typed with the values each message takes. A test checks that every message has a French translation with the same arguments.

### Minor Changes

- 712dfcb: Add `@panneau/actions`: it runs the actions that lists and forms hand over. `ActionRunnerProvider` asks for the parameters of an action in a dialog (with the forms of `@panneau/forms`, client validation and the `422` errors of the action endpoint), runs it through an adapter (`runAction()`, `getActionRun()`, `cancelActionRun()` of a `DataAdapter`), shows its result (a toast with its message and counts, and the items that didn't succeed), calls `onResult` to refresh, opens downloads, follows redirects, and follows queued runs until they end. `useActionRunner(resource)` is the `onAction` of a list; `ActionRuns` lists the runs with their progress. `link` actions go through `onNavigate`, and `client` actions render the handler that a plugin registers. `@panneau/intl` has its messages, in English and French. In `@panneau/lists`, an `onAction` that gives `false` keeps the selection (the action didn't run), and resource actions show in the toolbar of a list that has no search, filters, sorting or layouts.
- Add the messages of `@panneau/lists` (`listsMessages`), in English and French, to the catalogs.

### Patch Changes

- 9c844ee: Relation fields show the labels of values that are only ids (`"12"`), and can create items from the picker. `RelationSource` has two optional methods: `resolve(resource, ids)`, which gives the references of ids (fields that show the same ids share one request), and `create(resource, text)`, with `canCreate(resource)`, which the picker offers as "Create “…”". `createRelationSource()` resolves ids with the adapter's `get()`, and creates items with its `create()` when given `create: true` (the text becomes the `itemTitle`, in every locale when it is localized) or a function that gives the values. `RelationField` takes `onCreate`, which can open a dialog and resolves with the new reference. `useRelationReferences()` resolves references for other components. In `@panneau/lists`, relation filters resolve the labels of ids that come from the URL, for their chips and picker. `@panneau/intl` has the new messages, in English and French.
