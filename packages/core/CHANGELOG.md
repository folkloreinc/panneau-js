## 5.0.0-alpha.10

### Minor Changes

- 2fcd438: A chosen file counts as filled, and rules can be limited to the create or update mode of a form.
  
  - `@panneau/protocol`: `isFilled()` counts a file chosen in the browser (`File`, `Blob`) as filled, and other collections by their `length` or `size` (an empty `FileList`, `Map` or `Set` isn't filled), so a required `file` field saves without direct uploads, its file sent in `multipart/form-data` (#163). `accept` and `maxSize` read the type and size of such a file. A portable rule takes `"mode": "create"` or `"mode": "update"`, to apply in that mode only: a password required to create a user, optional to edit one (#164). `checkValues()` applies it in the mode of its options, and `checkRules()` takes the mode as a fourth argument; without a mode, such a rule is skipped. The conformance kit checks that a backend doesn't apply a `required` limited to `create` to updates.
  - `@panneau/core`: `resolveFields()` and `resolveForm()` with a mode keep the rules of that mode, without their `mode`, in nested fields too, and drop those of the other. A form has a `mode` (`form.mode`): its `mode` option, or `update` with a version and `create` without. Two different files are no longer equal for `isEqual()`, so choosing another file is a change.
  - `@panneau/fields`: the required mark and the other rules read by fields (`findRule()`, `isRequired()`) ignore a rule limited to a mode until the form resolves it.
  - `@panneau/forms`: `Form` infers its mode as `useForm()` does when it has no `mode` prop, and `FormView` resolves its fields in the mode of its form, so the required mark matches the rules checked on save. In `create` mode, both leave out `updateOnly` fields, as the checks already did.
- 68f5322: Lists have the `show`, `edit` and `delete` buttons of v4 again, and `duplicate`: every resource has these four item actions without declaring them, shown on the items whose abilities allow them. A resource can also open its items in their form instead of the panel (decision 0040).
  
  - `@panneau/protocol`:
      - The built-in item actions `show`, `edit`, `duplicate` and `delete` need their ability on an item: `view`, `update`, `duplicate`, `delete`. A missing or false ability hides them. A resource picks some of them, in its order, with `itemActions` (`["edit", "delete"]`, `[]` for none). A declared action with one of these ids replaces the built-in one, takes its `placement`, `confirm`, `destructive` and `dryRun` when it doesn't set them, and its `label` is optional. The id set to `false` hides the action too (`"edit": false`). An item without abilities shows none of the four.
      - The ids `show` and `edit` are reserved for `link` actions; every other action needs a `label`. The generated JSON Schema and OpenAPI document check both with `if`/`then`, and also that a `link` has a `url` or a `route` and a `client` action a `component`, as the Zod schemas do.
      - `POST /resources/{resource}/{id}/duplicate` copies an item, and answers `201` with the copy, or a `409` problem when the copy conflicts with another item (a unique value).
      - A resource takes `open`: `panel` (the default) or `edit`, where an item's title goes.
      - `BUILT_IN_ITEM_ACTIONS`, `ITEM_ACTION_ABILITIES`, `isBuiltInItemAction()`, `BUILT_IN_LINK_ACTIONS` and `isBuiltInLink()` are in the runtime entry point.
      - The mock backend allows the four on its items, duplicates items, and answers dry runs of the built-in `delete`. It reads abilities as clients do: a missing ability doesn't allow an action, in dry runs, in `delete` (skipped items are reported, and the only item of an item action is a `403`) and in `duplicate` (`403`). Its example definition shows `itemActions` and `open`.
      - The conformance kit checks that the built-in `delete` answers a dry run without being declared (`action.delete`) and, with `writes`, the duplication of an item that allows it, with the `ETag` of the copy (`duplicate`).
  - `@panneau/core`: `getItemActions(resource, item, surface)` decides the actions of an item on each surface, `row`, `menu`, `panel` and `form`, each with its link or to run: the built-in item actions (from `itemActions`, replaced by declared ones with their ids), then the declared actions, by their placement and the item's abilities, without the one that leads to the surface (no `show` in the panel, no `edit` in the form). `form` is the header of the item, in its panel and its form, so an item shows the same actions in its row, its panel and its form. `selectItemActions()` does the same with actions already placed, and `fillActionUrl()` fills a URL template. `getResourceActions()` gives the actions of a resource with its built-in item actions (and without `show` when items open in their form): `show` and `edit` in rows and headers, `duplicate` and `delete` in the menu of rows and headers, `delete` on selections too, so lists are selectable. `isActionAllowedOn()` checks the abilities of the built-in item actions, also on an item without abilities, which shows none of them: a declared `show` or `edit` is now hidden on an item without `view: true` or `update: true`. `getOpenMode()` reads `open`.
  - `@panneau/intl`: `getActionLabel()` labels an action, and the built-in item actions in the locale: "View", "Edit", "Duplicate", "Delete" ("Voir", "Modifier", "Dupliquer", "Supprimer").
  - `@panneau/lists`: rows and their menu show the actions of `selectItemActions()`. `ListView` takes `getLinkHref`, which resolves the built-in links and the links with a `route`, and leaves out the built-in links it can't resolve. `isAllowedOn()` follows the abilities of the built-in item actions.
  - `@panneau/data`: `duplicate()` on the data adapter (optional), in the REST adapter, and `useDuplicateItem()`.
  - `@panneau/actions`: results and runs label actions with `getActionLabel()`.
  - `@panneau/app`: rows, their menu, the panel and the edit form show the actions of `getItemActions()`, and the panel and the form with the same component: "Edit", "Duplicate", "Delete" and the declared links in the panel, "View", "Duplicate", "Delete" and the declared links in the form. The panel now shows only the actions placed in `form`, as the form does; links with a `route` are links in rows too, and links outside the admin open in a new tab. `duplicate` asks first when a form has unsaved changes, then copies the item and opens the copy in its form; it is left out with an adapter that can't duplicate. Deleting from the panel closes it. The links of the panel's header have the class of the edit page's (`.panneau-pages-action-link`): `.panneau-item-panel-action` is gone. With `"open": "edit"`, titles open the form, and the show route redirects there with its hash, after the `viewAny` check of the list; an item that can't be updated still opens in the panel. While the item loads, the show route shows nothing rather than the list for an instant.

## 5.0.0-alpha.9

### Minor Changes

- 30f227f: Lists can be paged with cursors, for lists too large to count (decision 0039).
  
  - `@panneau/protocol`: a list's definition takes `"pagination": "cursor"`. Its pages take `cursor` in the query (`ListQuery.cursor`, `?cursor=…`), and answer `meta: { perPage, nextCursor, previousCursor?, total? }` (`CursorPagination`) instead of page numbers. `meta` of `ListResponse` is now either kind: code that read `meta.total` or `meta.lastPage` checks which with `isCursorPage()` of `@panneau/protocol/runtime`. The mock backend pages such lists with cursors, and the conformance kit accepts them.
  - `@panneau/core`: the list state of a list paged with cursors has no `page`. `nextPage(cursor)` and `previousPage(previousCursor?)` move through its pages, back through the cursors it followed when the backend gives no `previousCursor`. Another sort, filter, search or page size starts over.
  - `@panneau/lists`: `ListView` takes `cursors` (`{ next, previous? }`) and shows the previous and next pages without page numbers (`CursorPagination`). `getPagingProps(meta)` gives a `ListView` its `total` or its `cursors` from the `meta` of a page.
  - `@panneau/media` and `@panneau/app` follow the cursors of the lists and media libraries paged with them.

## 5.0.0-alpha.8

### Patch Changes

- 83c82d4: The declaration files work in TypeScript projects on `"module": "NodeNext"`. Their relative specifiers now name their file (`./schemas/index.js`, `./rest.js`), so the types that an entry point re-exports, such as `Definition` of `@panneau/protocol`, are no longer missing under Node's resolution, and the CSS Modules that some declarations imported are declared in place. Nothing changes for projects on the `Bundler` resolution.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [060e0de]
  - @panneau/protocol@5.0.0-alpha.7

## 5.0.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- 75a6496: Five more field types ([decision 0033](../docs/decisions/0033-more-field-types.md)):
  
  - **`tel`:** a phone number, as typed, with the phone keyboard. Lists link it with `tel:`.
  - **`range`:** a number on a slider, between the `min` and `max` rules (0 and 100 without them), with `step`, `decimals` and `suffix`. It is `null` until the slider is moved.
  - **`duration`:** a number of seconds, typed in hours, minutes and seconds; `settings.precision` hides the seconds. Lists show it with its units: `1 h 5 min 30 s`.
  - **`json`:** an object or an array, edited as JSON text. Text that doesn't parse stays a string, which the new `json` portable rule refuses: the `json` type implies it, so a form can't be saved with it.
  - **`tags`:** a list of strings, typed or among `options`. `settings.allowCustom: false` allows only the options. Lists show them as badges.
  
  And:
  
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:** the five types in `BUILT_IN_FIELD_TYPES`, and the `json` rule in `PORTABLE_RULES` and `checkRules()`.
  - **`@panneau/ui`:** `Slider`, and `TagsInput`, whose tags are added with Enter, a comma or a paste, and removed with Backspace or their button.
  - **`@panneau/fields`:** `TelField`, `RangeField`, `DurationField` (with `formatDuration()`), `JsonField` (with `parseJson()`) and `TagsField`, at `@panneau/fields/tel`, `/range`, `/duration`, `/json` and `/tags`.
  - **`@panneau/lists`:** `TelDisplay`, `DurationDisplay`, `JsonDisplay` and `TagsDisplay`; `range` shows as a number.
  - **`@panneau/core`:** the message of the `json` rule.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the messages of the new fields and rule, in English and French.

## 5.0.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- 3830b4f: Navigating the app shell no longer loses unsaved changes, and announces each page:
  
  - **`@panneau/core`:** `createLeaveGuards()`, `LeaveGuardsProvider` and `useLeaveGuard()` let a router ask the forms below it before leaving a page.
  - **`@panneau/forms`:** under a `LeaveGuardsProvider`, a form with unsaved changes (`guardUnsavedChanges`, on by default) asks in a dialog before the router leaves its page, not only before the page closes or reloads.
  - **`@panneau/app`:**
      - links, "Go to…" and actions ask before leaving a form with unsaved changes, and so do the browser's back and forward buttons;
      - the tab is named after the page (`Ten walks for the fall · Articles · Northwind Journal`);
      - when the route changes, focus moves to the title of the new page and the page scrolls to the top. Opening the panel of an item focuses the panel, and closing it gives focus back to the item's link.
- b86f35e: A "Go to…" command palette ([decision 0029](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0029-go-to-palette.md)), which products can also use without the app:
  
  - `@panneau/ui`:
      - `CommandPalette`: a search field over groups of items to go to or run, in a dialog near the top of the screen (the whole screen on a phone).
      - It matches items without case or accents, needs every word to match, and ranks the best matches first (`matchCommands()`, `normalizeSearch()`). Groups that are already `matched`, such as results of a server, are shown as they are, after the others.
      - `useCommandShortcut()` opens it with ⌘K or Ctrl+K, unless something already handled the key.
      - Tokens: `--panneau-command-palette-*`.
  - `@panneau/core`: plugins add `commands` (`Command`, `getCommands()`). `isSearchable()` and `getSearchableResources()` tell which resources the global search covers: `features.search`, which defaults to `list.search`.
  - `@panneau/data`: `useSearch()`, `searchQueryOptions()` and `queryKeys.search()`.
  - `@panneau/protocol`:
      - resources get `itemSubtitle` and `itemImage`, next to `itemTitle`;
      - `features.search` defaults to `list.search`;
      - the mock backend answers `GET /search`: 5 items per resource, 20 in all, from 2 characters.
  - `@panneau/app`: "Go to…" in the sidebar (an icon when collapsed), in the phone's top bar, and on ⌘K or Ctrl+K.
      - It lists recent items, kept in the browser, then the navigation, "New {resource}", the commands of plugins and the app's actions.
      - The server's search results follow, grouped by resource, with their subtitle and image.
      - An item opens its edit form.
  - `@panneau/intl`: the messages of the palette, in English and French.
- 6d1f1d8: Previews of items, in the panel of the show route ([decisions 0009 and 0028](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0028-item-panel.md)):
  
  - `@panneau/core`: plugins register preview components by name in `previews`, for resources whose `features.preview` is `{ "mode": "component", "component": "<name>" }`. They get `PreviewProps`: the item, its resource and the locale, to render the page as the site shows it, blocks, partials or charts.
  - `@panneau/data`: `previewItem()`, optional on adapters and implemented by the REST adapter, posts values to `POST /resources/{resource}/{id}/preview` and returns the short-lived URL of the item's page. `useItemPreview()`, `itemPreviewQueryOptions()` and `queryKeys.itemPreview()` fetch it.
  - `@panneau/protocol`: the mock backend answers the preview route, with a `data:` page of the item's values, or the URL of its `previewUrl` option.
  - `@panneau/app`: the panel of an item opens on a Preview tab, before its Details, when its resource has a preview, and remembers the tab. A button widens the panel, for previews (`--panneau-item-panel-width-wide`, half of the page by default).
  - `@panneau/intl`: the messages of previews, in English and French.

### Patch Changes

- 5779047: The global search reads `limit` and `resources`, and can be narrowed to one resource ([decision 0030](../docs/decisions/0030-search-parameters-and-scope.md)):
  
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:**
      - `GET /search` takes `limit` (1 to 20, 5 by default) and `resources` (comma-separated searchable resources). An invalid parameter is a `422` problem keyed by parameter, and a backend may answer `429` with `Retry-After`.
      - `readSearchQuery()`, `toSearchQueryParams()`, `isSearchableResource()` and the `SEARCH_*` limits are in `@panneau/protocol/runtime`. The mock backend uses them, and `openapi.json` documents them.
      - `runConformance()` checks the search: `search`, `search.scope` and `search.invalid`.
  - **`@panneau/data`:** `adapter.search(q, { limit, resources })`, `useSearch(q, { limit, resources })` and `searchQueryOptions(adapter, q, { limit, resources })`. Search keys are now `['panneau', 'search', q, options]`. A `429` is a `RateLimitedError`, with `retryAfter` from `Retry-After` (`readRetryAfter()`).
  - **`@panneau/ui`:** `CommandPalette` takes a `scope`, shown as a chip before the field, and `onScopeRemove`, called by Backspace in the empty field or the chip's button. Items with `keepsOpen` don't close it. Without results, its list shows its `status`.
  - **`@panneau/core`:** `isSearchable()` uses the protocol's `isSearchableResource()`.
  - **`@panneau/app`:** "Search in" narrows "Go to…" to one resource, with 20 results. "See all N results" opens the list of a resource, searched, when it has more results than shown. Too many searches are said in the palette.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the messages of the scope, in English and French.

## 5.0.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- d5cd252: Typed, composable themes (decision 0024, step 3). `@panneau/ui` adds `defineTheme()`, which type-checks token names, builds on other themes with `extends` and reports unknown tokens, a `palette` for themes (`--panneau-palette-<name>`), `mergeThemes()`, `findUnknownTokens()`, `SEMANTIC_TOKENS` and `PanneauTokens` for a project's own tokens. `@panneau/protocol` adds the `Theme` schema, `theme.schema.json` and `mergeThemes()`, and `definition.theme` now carries a theme that extends themes of plugins by id. The `Theme` of `@panneau/core` plugins is now that of the protocol, and `resolveTheme()` merges the theme of a definition.

  - @panneau/protocol@5.0.0-alpha.2

## 5.0.0-alpha.1

### Major Changes

- b1d02aa: Add `@panneau/core`: the plugin registry (`definePlugin`, `PanneauProvider`), the definition engine (`resolveForm`, `resolveList`, abilities), form state behind a `FormStore` (dot-path values, dirty tracking, portable-rule validation, server errors, visibility, submit with version conflicts), list state (query, selection, URL sync through a `Router`) and their React hooks (`useForm`, `useFormField`, `useList`, `usePlugins`, `useResource`).

### Minor Changes

- dfb0b1f: Add pure selectors of a form state to `@panneau/core`: `selectValue(state, path)`, `selectErrors(state, path, { nested })`, `selectErrorCount(state, paths)` and `selectVisible(state, target, parentPath)`. Components read the state they subscribed to with them. The form's reading methods (`getValue()`, `getErrors()`, `countErrors()`, `isVisible()`) are now documented as non-React APIs: the React Compiler memoizes their calls by their arguments, so they return stale results in components. `@panneau/forms` uses the selectors of `@panneau/core` instead of its own.

### Patch Changes

- 2565d67: Add `@panneau/protocol/runtime`: the constants of the protocol and the helpers that run in the browser (`checkValues()`, `checkRules()`, `evaluateCondition()`, `lintDefinition()`, `getValue()`, `isFilled()`, `isProblem()`, `toSearchParams()`, `fromSearchParams()`), without loading zod. The main entry point still exports everything. `isProblem()` no longer uses the `Problem` schema, and accepts the same values. `@panneau/core` and `@panneau/fields` import the helpers from there, so zod (about 360 KB of source) is no longer in the bundles of products that use the forms and lists.
- b3c9d6c: Range filters (`date-range`) send their bounds as their own keys: `filter[published_at][from]=2026-01-01&filter[published_at][to]=2026-01-31`, both inclusive, with an open end left out. `FilterValue` can be a `FilterRange` (`{ from?, to? }`), which `toSearchParams()` and `fromSearchParams()` read and write, and the protocol adds `isFilterRange()` and `matchesFilterRange()`, the reference of how a backend reads the bounds. The mock backend filters by ranges, and the conformance kit checks that a backend reads the bounds of a resource's `date-range` filter. `@panneau/lists` sends a date range as a `FilterRange` instead of `[from, to]` with an empty string for an open end, and filters items in memory by ranges. `@panneau/core` drops an empty range from the query.
