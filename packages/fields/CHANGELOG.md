## 5.0.0-alpha.13

### Minor Changes

- b07c7ab: Countries, regions and phone numbers ([decision 0047](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0047-countries-regions-and-phone-numbers.md)).
  
  - **`country`:** a new built-in type, an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (`CA`). `CountryField` (`@panneau/fields/country`) picks it by name in the user's locale, with its flag; `settings.countries` limits the choices and `settings.preferred` puts some first. Lists show the flag and the name.
  - **`region`:** a new built-in type, a state, a province or a territory of the country in the field that `from` names, or of `settings.country`. `RegionField` (`@panneau/fields/region`) picks among the regions of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States, named in English or French, and gives the code without the country (`QC`); for other countries, it is a text. Lists show the name.
  - **`tel` values are now E.164** (`+15145550199`). **Breaking:** the new `tel` rule, implied by the type, refuses numbers kept as typed. `TelField` shows the country of the number, its flag and its calling code in a menu at the start of the input, formats the number as it is typed, follows a number typed with its calling code, and turns a number as typed into E.164 when the field is left. `settings.country` (`country`) is the country of a new number. Lists show the flag and the international format.
  - `@panneau/ui`: options of `Select` and items of `ComboBox` take a decorative `prefix`; `ComboBox` takes a `prefix` before its input; `Select` takes `renderValue` and `appearance="bare"`, to sit inside another control.
  - `@panneau/fields` depends on `libphonenumber-js`.
  - `@panneau/ui`: a `TextInput` with a prefix or a suffix, and a `ComboBox`, now look read-only when they are (`isReadOnly`); a read-only `ComboBox` has no button to show its options.

### Patch Changes

- f3036ed: The rest of the UI follows the abilities of the current user (decision 0046): pages and fields have abilities, menus leave out what the user can't reach, and a route reached without the ability shows a forbidden state.
  
  - `@panneau/protocol`: `abilities` on a page (`{ "view": false }`) and on a field (`{ "view": false }`, `{ "update": false }`), where only `false` restricts. The JSON Schema and the OpenAPI document follow. The mock backend reads the abilities of resources (`403` on lists without `viewAny`, on creates without `create`), of items (`403` without `view`, `update` or `delete`), and of fields (items leave out the values of hidden fields, writes ignore those of fields the user can't see or update); an item of `items` can give its own `abilities`. The conformance kit checks that resources without `viewAny` answer `403` on their list, that items leave out hidden fields, that a dry run of `delete` skips an item without `delete` and, with `writes`, that an empty create of a resource without `create` and an empty update of an item without `update` answer `403`.
  - `@panneau/core`: `canViewField()`, `canUpdateField()`, `getVisibleFields()` and `canViewPage()`. `resolveFields()` and `resolveForm()` leave out the fields the user can't see, and make those they can't edit read-only. `resolveList()` leaves the fields the user can't see out of columns and sorts, and those they can't edit out of `inlineEdit`.
  - `@panneau/fields`: a field with `abilities.update: false` is read-only.
  - `@panneau/intl`: the message of an item the user can't view (`itemForbidden`).
  - `@panneau/app`: the forbidden error page (`ErrorPage` with `kind="forbidden"`) also shows on the create route of a resource without `create`, and on a page with `view: false`. The item panel says when the user can't view the item, without "Retry". The edit route of an item without `update: true` goes to its panel. `pages.home` with `view: false` shows the built-in home. Menus leave out the pages the user can't open, and the separators left at their start, at their end or next to another one. Lists, panels and forms leave out the fields the user can't see.

## 5.0.0-alpha.12

### Patch Changes

- 0a8447e: Localized fields show one locale at a time, as in Panneau 4, and forms use the width they have.
  
  - `@panneau/fields`: a localized field shows the input of one locale under its label, with a switch of the locales (`FR`, `EN`) at the end of the label's line. The switch marks a locale in error with a red dot, and an empty locale with an amber dot when the field is required, or with `+` when it isn't: a translation to add. The first locale shows first; every input stays mounted. `LocalizedField` takes `locale` and `onLocaleChange` to control the locale shown, and `invalidLocales`. The input of a locale has no visible label: `label` of `LocalizedInputProps` is meant for its `aria-label`. Field entries take `hideLabel` (also on `NestedField`), which `getFieldProps()` turns into an `aria-label`, and `invalidPaths`, the paths in error inside the field, which a binding gives to fields that show their nested fields. The fields of a group flow in columns of at least 14rem: short fields share a row, and wide ones take a row of their own. `isWideField()` tells them apart: text areas, groups, repeaters, localized fields, several values, radios and checkboxes, and the types of plugins are wide. `RevealContext`, `createRevealRegistry()` and `useRevealer()` let fields that hide some of their own show the path a form reveals.
  - `@panneau/forms`: the fields that a layout doesn't place, which is every field of a form without a layout, flow in columns of at least 16rem after the layout, and in the form's skeleton too. `Form` gives `FormView` its layout as given. When it focuses the field of an error, a form first shows its locale, as it opens its tab or section. The errors of a localized field are listed, and the first one focused, in the order of the form's locales, not alphabetically. Its reveal registry is the one of `@panneau/fields`.
  - `@panneau/ui`: `Fieldset` takes `legendEnd`, controls at the end of the legend's line. The group is then named by the legend through `aria-labelledby`.
  - `@panneau/app`: the form of an item takes the width of a list (80rem) when its layout has a sidebar.
  - `@panneau/intl`: messages of the locale switch, in English and French.
  
  The `panneau-localized-field-locales` class is removed: the locales of a localized field are in a `panneau-fieldset`.

  - @panneau/protocol@5.0.0-alpha.11

## 5.0.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- 2fcd438: A chosen file counts as filled, and rules can be limited to the create or update mode of a form.
  
  - `@panneau/protocol`: `isFilled()` counts a file chosen in the browser (`File`, `Blob`) as filled, and other collections by their `length` or `size` (an empty `FileList`, `Map` or `Set` isn't filled), so a required `file` field saves without direct uploads, its file sent in `multipart/form-data` (#163). `accept` and `maxSize` read the type and size of such a file. A portable rule takes `"mode": "create"` or `"mode": "update"`, to apply in that mode only: a password required to create a user, optional to edit one (#164). `checkValues()` applies it in the mode of its options, and `checkRules()` takes the mode as a fourth argument; without a mode, such a rule is skipped. The conformance kit checks that a backend doesn't apply a `required` limited to `create` to updates.
  - `@panneau/core`: `resolveFields()` and `resolveForm()` with a mode keep the rules of that mode, without their `mode`, in nested fields too, and drop those of the other. A form has a `mode` (`form.mode`): its `mode` option, or `update` with a version and `create` without. Two different files are no longer equal for `isEqual()`, so choosing another file is a change.
  - `@panneau/fields`: the required mark and the other rules read by fields (`findRule()`, `isRequired()`) ignore a rule limited to a mode until the form resolves it.
  - `@panneau/forms`: `Form` infers its mode as `useForm()` does when it has no `mode` prop, and `FormView` resolves its fields in the mode of its form, so the required mark matches the rules checked on save. In `create` mode, both leave out `updateOnly` fields, as the checks already did.

## 5.0.0-alpha.9

### Minor Changes

- ca1aa46: Secret text fields, and options with a tone.
  
  - `text` fields with `"settings": { "secret": true }` hold a secret, such as an access key: the field types it in a password input, with a button that shows it, and keeps the browser from filling it in (`autocomplete="new-password"`). Lists and item details show it as dots. `TextField` takes `secret`.
  - The options of `select` fields take a `tone` (`{ "value": "failed", "label": "Failed", "tone": "danger" }`): a built-in tone or one of the theme. The `select` display of lists and item details shows each option as a badge in its tone.

## 5.0.0-alpha.8

### Patch Changes

- 83c82d4: The declaration files work in TypeScript projects on `"module": "NodeNext"`. Their relative specifiers now name their file (`./schemas/index.js`, `./rest.js`), so the types that an entry point re-exports, such as `Definition` of `@panneau/protocol`, are no longer missing under Node's resolution, and the CSS Modules that some declarations imported are declared in place. Nothing changes for projects on the `Bundler` resolution.

## 5.0.0-alpha.7

### Patch Changes

- 9c6c087: Every component is memoized by the React Compiler again. The packages were built with Babel 8, on which React Compiler 1.0 skips any component with a default value in its props (`Fieldset`, `Text`, `TextInput` and most others), so they shipped without memoization. The build is back on Babel 7, and the components the compiler still skipped (`Panneau`, `FormView`, `ListView`, `Select`, the file, location, embed, slug and relation fields, `MediaField`, `MediaPicker` and `ImageEditor`) are rewritten so that it compiles them. Nothing changes in their behavior.
- 060e0de: Add `@panneau/editor` (#128, decision 0007): the `richtext` field, on TipTap 3, which stores HTML. `editorPlugin` provides the field type; `createEditorPlugin({ extensions, buttons })` adds the TipTap extensions of a project (an inline logo) and the toolbar buttons that insert them.
  
  - The definition sets the toolbar, the heading levels, block styles (a named class on an element: `<p class="big">`) and which links open in a new tab, in `settings`. `@panneau/protocol` describes them with `RichTextSettings` and `RichTextStyle`, and `validateDefinition()` checks them.
  - HTML written by CKEditor 4 and 5 loads as it was written, and the field gives nothing back until the text is edited. Once edited, it renders the same: the field keeps every heading level, the attributes and classes of blocks and marks, `<b>` and `<i>`, bare list items, and the HTML it doesn't edit (media embeds, iframes, tables, social posts), shown in the editor without rendering it.
  - Nothing that would run a script reaches the admin (decision 0035): HTML the field doesn't edit is shown inert, and the elements it renders lose their event handlers and `javascript:` URLs.
  - Pasted content brings its text, structure, links and marks, not the styles and wrappers of its page (Google Docs, web pages); only content copied from a rich text field of the same page pastes in full.
  - `normalizeRichText()` gives the HTML the field would save for existing content, to check it before a migration.
  - `@panneau/intl` has the messages of the editor, in English and French (`editorMessages`).

## 5.0.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- 75a6496: Two more field types ([decision 0033](../docs/decisions/0033-more-field-types.md)):
  
  - **`embed`:** the URL of a video, a sound or a post. The backend resolves it with the provider's oEmbed (`GET /embeds?url=`), and the field shows its title and thumbnail. Without the endpoint, the value is `{ url }`.
  - **`location`:** a point and its address, `{ lat, lng, address }`, placed on a Leaflet map loaded on demand, typed, or found by address through a pluggable geocoding source.
  
  And:
  
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:** `EmbedValue`, `EmbedResponse` and `LocationValue`, `GET /embeds` in the OpenAPI document, the two types in `BUILT_IN_FIELD_TYPES`, and `/embeds` in the mock backend.
  - **`@panneau/data`:** `resolveEmbed()`, optional in `DataAdapter`, implemented by the REST adapter.
  - **`@panneau/fields`:** `EmbedField` and `LocationField` at `@panneau/fields/embed` and `/location`; `createEmbedSource()`; the `embedSource` and `maps` of `FieldsProvider`; `GeocodingSource` and `createNominatimSource()`.
  - **`@panneau/lists`:** `EmbedDisplay` and `LocationDisplay`.
  - **`@panneau/app`:** the `maps` option, and the embed source of the adapter.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the messages of the new fields, in English and French.
- 75a6496: Five more field types ([decision 0033](../docs/decisions/0033-more-field-types.md)):
  
  - **`tel`:** a phone number, as typed, with the phone keyboard. Lists link it with `tel:`.
  - **`range`:** a number on a slider, between the `min` and `max` rules (0 and 100 without them), with `step`, `decimals` and `suffix`. It is `null` until the slider is moved.
  - **`duration`:** a number of seconds, typed in hours, minutes and seconds; `settings.precision` hides the seconds. Lists show it with its units: `1 h 5 min 30 s`.
  - **`json`:** an object or an array, edited as JSON text. Text that doesn't parse stays a string, which the new `json` portable rule refuses: the `json` type implies it, so a form can't be saved with it.
  - **`tags`:** a list of strings, typed or among `options`. `settings.allowCustom: false` allows only the options. Lists show them as badges.
  
  And:
  
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:** the five types in `BUILT_IN_FIELD_TYPES`, and the `json` rule in `PORTABLE_RULES` and `checkRules()`.
  - **`@panneau/ui`:** `Slider`, and `TagsInput`, whose tags are added with Enter, a comma or a paste, and removed with Backspace or their button.
  - **`@panneau/fields`:** `TelField`, `RangeField`, `DurationField` (with `formatDuration()`), `JsonField` (with `parseJson()`) and `TagsField`, at `@panneau/fields/tel`, `/range`, `/duration`, `/json` and `/tags`.
  - **`@panneau/lists`:** `TelDisplay`, `DurationDisplay`, `JsonDisplay` and `TagsDisplay`; `range` shows as a number.
  - **`@panneau/core`:** the message of the `json` rule.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the messages of the new fields and rule, in English and French.

## 5.0.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- 88a3d09: Fields check their value with the backend, and the slug field does what sites' `PageSlug` did (decision 0032). A field with `check: true` sends `POST /resources/{resource}/fields/{field}/check` as it is typed (`FieldCheckRequest`), and the backend answers whether the value is available, a free suggestion, the URL's `prefix` and `url`, and `disabled` for an item the field doesn't apply to (`FieldCheckResponse`). The mock backend answers it, and the conformance kit checks it (`fields.check`). `DataAdapter.checkField?()` sends it; `createFieldCheckSource(adapter, resource, id)` gives the fields context its `checkSource`, which `FormView` takes too. The `slug` field follows its source in its own locale, or in the default one, shows the backend's URL, and offers the suggestion when the slug is taken. Field entries get the `locale` of the value they edit.

### Patch Changes

- 8372b27: A `media` field can allow several libraries (decision 0027). Its `resource` takes a list of library ids, and without one it allows every library of the definition, instead of being an error when there are several. `MediaReference` gets `resource`, its library: ids are unique only within their library, so a field that allows several needs it in requests, and the mock backend refuses a media without it. `getMediaLibraries(definition, field)` (in `@panneau/protocol/runtime`) gives the libraries a field allows. `lintDefinition()` checks each listed id, and that a `relation` field names one resource. `getLibrary()` of `@panneau/media` takes a list too, and gives the first library: the field uploads to it, the references it makes carry their library, and it reads each media in its own library. The `relation` field ignores a list in `resource`.

## 5.0.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- 3974fb5: The `file` field and uploads to storage (decision 0025). `FileField` (`@panneau/fields/file`, built in as the `file` type) holds files that belong to an item: stored files (`{ name, url, mime, size }`), uploads (`{ upload, name, mime, size }`) or the files themselves, single or a list with `multiple`, with remove and replace, and `accept` and `maxSize` checked before sending. Fields upload through an `UploadSource`, given to `FieldsProvider` as `uploadSource` like the relation source; without one, values hold the files themselves. The upload core is exported for other fields: `useUploads()`, `UploadList` (progress, pause, resume, cancel, retry), `FilePicker` (button and drop zone), `formatSize()`, `matchesMime()`, `getAccept()`, `getMaxSize()`. `@panneau/fields/uppy` adds `createUppyUploadSource()`, on Uppy 6 with the backend's signatures: `@uppy/core` and `@uppy/aws-s3` 6.3 are optional peer dependencies, only for that entry point. `react-aria-components` is now a peer dependency.

## 5.0.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- 3befc22: Class names are now stable and readable, without a hash, so that projects can target them like Bootstrap's: `.panneau-card`, `.panneau-card-header`, `.panneau-button-sm` (decision 0024). Each package lists its classes in `api/<package>.classes.md`. They are public API.

### Patch Changes

- f86c757: Global element rules of a site, such as Bootstrap's Reboot, no longer leak into Panneau: a `h5` card title no longer gets `margin-bottom: 0.5rem`, legends no longer float, and dividers are no longer faded. The reset of the root now weighs two element selectors, more than a site's element rules and less than any class, and components reset the elements they render (titles, legends, paragraphs, lists, rules) in their own classes.
- 27a1e08: Typography roles and fonts in themes (decision 0024, step 4). `@panneau/ui` adds the font roles `--panneau-font-family-body`, `-heading` and `-display` (`--panneau-font-family` is now a deprecated alias of the body family), `--panneau-font-numeric`, the `Heading` component with its size tokens (1 to 4, `display-1`, `display-2`), `Text`, and an opt-in `Prose` container for rich content. Themes take `fonts`, font faces or hosted stylesheets, which `PanneauRoot` adds to the page once. `bootstrapTheme` now sets the body family. `@panneau/protocol` adds `fonts` to the `Theme` schema. Numbers in fields and lists use `--panneau-font-numeric`.

## 5.0.0-alpha.1

### Major Changes

- e5a3533: Add `@panneau/fields`: controlled fields for the protocol's built-in types (text, textarea, number, boolean, date, datetime, time, select, email, url, color, slug, localized values, group, repeater with typed blocks, relation), one subpath per field. Each subpath also exports the registry entry of its type; `builtInFields` and `fieldsPlugin` gather them, and `FieldsProvider` gives nested fields their components, locales, relation source and a binding to a store by path. `createRelationSource()` searches any adapter with a `list()` method, such as `@panneau/data`'s. `richtext` and `media` render a placeholder until their plugins exist.

### Minor Changes

- 8d1313a: The messages of `@panneau/ui`, `@panneau/fields` and `@panneau/forms` now live in `@panneau/intl`. `@panneau/ui/locales`, `@panneau/fields/locales` and `@panneau/forms/locales` still export the `en` and `fr` messages of their package, but are deprecated: use `withPanneauMessages()`, `en` or `fr` from `@panneau/intl`, which have the messages of every package. `fieldsPlugin` now carries the French messages of every package, those of `@panneau/forms` included.
- 9c844ee: Relation fields show the labels of values that are only ids (`"12"`), and can create items from the picker. `RelationSource` has two optional methods: `resolve(resource, ids)`, which gives the references of ids (fields that show the same ids share one request), and `create(resource, text)`, with `canCreate(resource)`, which the picker offers as "Create “…”". `createRelationSource()` resolves ids with the adapter's `get()`, and creates items with its `create()` when given `create: true` (the text becomes the `itemTitle`, in every locale when it is localized) or a function that gives the values. `RelationField` takes `onCreate`, which can open a dialog and resolves with the new reference. `useRelationReferences()` resolves references for other components. In `@panneau/lists`, relation filters resolve the labels of ids that come from the URL, for their chips and picker. `@panneau/intl` has the new messages, in English and French.

### Patch Changes

- 2565d67: Add `@panneau/protocol/runtime`: the constants of the protocol and the helpers that run in the browser (`checkValues()`, `checkRules()`, `evaluateCondition()`, `lintDefinition()`, `getValue()`, `isFilled()`, `isProblem()`, `toSearchParams()`, `fromSearchParams()`), without loading zod. The main entry point still exports everything. `isProblem()` no longer uses the `Problem` schema, and accepts the same values. `@panneau/core` and `@panneau/fields` import the helpers from there, so zod (about 360 KB of source) is no longer in the bundles of products that use the forms and lists.
