# @panneau/fields

## 5.0.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- 75a6496: Two more field types ([decision 0033](../docs/decisions/0033-more-field-types.md)):
  
  - **`embed`:** the URL of a video, a sound or a post. The backend resolves it with the provider's oEmbed (`GET /embeds?url=`), and the field shows its title and thumbnail. Without the endpoint, the value is `{ url }`.
  - **`location`:** a point and its address, `{ lat, lng, address }`, placed on a Leaflet map loaded on demand, typed, or found by address through a pluggable geocoding source.
  
  And:
  
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:** `EmbedValue`, `EmbedResponse` and `LocationValue`, `GET /embeds` in the OpenAPI document, the two types in `BUILT_IN_FIELD_TYPES`, and `/embeds` in the mock backend.
  - **`@panneau/data`:** `resolveEmbed()`, optional in `DataAdapter`, implemented by the REST adapter.
  - **`@panneau/fields`:** `EmbedField` and `LocationField` at `@panneau/fields/embed` and `/location`; `createEmbedSource()`; the `embedSource` and `maps` of `FieldsProvider`; `GeocodingSource` and `createNominatimSource()`.
  - **`@panneau/lists`:** `EmbedDisplay` and `LocationDisplay`.
  - **`@panneau/app`:** the `maps` option, and the embed source of the adapter.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the messages of the new fields, in English and French.
- 75a6496: Five more field types ([decision 0033](../docs/decisions/0033-more-field-types.md)):
  
  - **`tel`:** a phone number, as typed, with the phone keyboard. Lists link it with `tel:`.
  - **`range`:** a number on a slider, between the `min` and `max` rules (0 and 100 without them), with `step`, `decimals` and `suffix`. It is `null` until the slider is moved.
  - **`duration`:** a number of seconds, typed in hours, minutes and seconds; `settings.precision` hides the seconds. Lists show it with its units: `1 h 5 min 30 s`.
  - **`json`:** an object or an array, edited as JSON text. Text that doesn't parse stays a string, which the new `json` portable rule refuses: the `json` type implies it, so a form can't be saved with it.
  - **`tags`:** a list of strings, typed or among `options`. `settings.allowCustom: false` allows only the options. Lists show them as badges.
  
  And:
  
  - **`@panneau/protocol`:** the five types in `BUILT_IN_FIELD_TYPES`, and the `json` rule in `PORTABLE_RULES` and `checkRules()`.
  - **`@panneau/ui`:** `Slider`, and `TagsInput`, whose tags are added with Enter, a comma or a paste, and removed with Backspace or their button.
  - **`@panneau/fields`:** `TelField`, `RangeField`, `DurationField` (with `formatDuration()`), `JsonField` (with `parseJson()`) and `TagsField`, at `@panneau/fields/tel`, `/range`, `/duration`, `/json` and `/tags`.
  - **`@panneau/lists`:** `TelDisplay`, `DurationDisplay`, `JsonDisplay` and `TagsDisplay`; `range` shows as a number.
  - **`@panneau/core`:** the message of the `json` rule.
  - **`@panneau/intl`:** the messages of the new fields and rule, in English and French.

## 5.0.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- 88a3d09: Fields check their value with the backend, and the slug field does what sites' `PageSlug` did (decision 0032). A field with `check: true` sends `POST /resources/{resource}/fields/{field}/check` as it is typed (`FieldCheckRequest`), and the backend answers whether the value is available, a free suggestion, the URL's `prefix` and `url`, and `disabled` for an item the field doesn't apply to (`FieldCheckResponse`). The mock backend answers it, and the conformance kit checks it (`fields.check`). `DataAdapter.checkField?()` sends it; `createFieldCheckSource(adapter, resource, id)` gives the fields context its `checkSource`, which `FormView` takes too. The `slug` field follows its source in its own locale, or in the default one, shows the backend's URL, and offers the suggestion when the slug is taken. Field entries get the `locale` of the value they edit.

### Patch Changes

- 8372b27: A `media` field can allow several libraries (decision 0027). Its `resource` takes a list of library ids, and without one it allows every library of the definition, instead of being an error when there are several. `MediaReference` gets `resource`, its library: ids are unique only within their library, so a field that allows several needs it in requests, and the mock backend refuses a media without it. `getMediaLibraries(definition, field)` (in `@panneau/protocol/runtime`) gives the libraries a field allows. `lintDefinition()` checks each listed id, and that a `relation` field names one resource. `getLibrary()` of `@panneau/media` takes a list too, and gives the first library: the field uploads to it, the references it makes carry their library, and it reads each media in its own library. The `relation` field ignores a list in `resource`.

## 5.0.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- 3974fb5: The `file` field and uploads to storage (decision 0025). `FileField` (`@panneau/fields/file`, built in as the `file` type) holds files that belong to an item: stored files (`{ name, url, mime, size }`), uploads (`{ upload, name, mime, size }`) or the files themselves, single or a list with `multiple`, with remove and replace, and `accept` and `maxSize` checked before sending. Fields upload through an `UploadSource`, given to `FieldsProvider` as `uploadSource` like the relation source; without one, values hold the files themselves. The upload core is exported for other fields: `useUploads()`, `UploadList` (progress, pause, resume, cancel, retry), `FilePicker` (button and drop zone), `formatSize()`, `matchesMime()`, `getAccept()`, `getMaxSize()`. `@panneau/fields/uppy` adds `createUppyUploadSource()`, on Uppy 6 with the backend's signatures: `@uppy/core` and `@uppy/aws-s3` 6.3 are optional peer dependencies, only for that entry point. `react-aria-components` is now a peer dependency.

## 5.0.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- 3befc22: Class names are now stable and readable, without a hash, so that projects can target them like Bootstrap's: `.panneau-card`, `.panneau-card-header`, `.panneau-button-sm` (decision 0024). Each package lists its classes in `api/<package>.classes.md`. They are public API.

### Patch Changes

- f86c757: Global element rules of a site, such as Bootstrap's Reboot, no longer leak into Panneau: a `h5` card title no longer gets `margin-bottom: 0.5rem`, legends no longer float, and dividers are no longer faded. The reset of the root now weighs two element selectors, more than a site's element rules and less than any class, and components reset the elements they render (titles, legends, paragraphs, lists, rules) in their own classes.
- 27a1e08: Typography roles and fonts in themes (decision 0024, step 4). `@panneau/ui` adds the font roles `--panneau-font-family-body`, `-heading` and `-display` (`--panneau-font-family` is now a deprecated alias of the body family), `--panneau-font-numeric`, the `Heading` component with its size tokens (1 to 4, `display-1`, `display-2`), `Text`, and an opt-in `Prose` container for rich content. Themes take `fonts`, font faces or hosted stylesheets, which `PanneauRoot` adds to the page once. `bootstrapTheme` now sets the body family. `@panneau/protocol` adds `fonts` to the `Theme` schema. Numbers in fields and lists use `--panneau-font-numeric`.

## 5.0.0-alpha.1

### Major Changes

- e5a3533: Add `@panneau/fields`: controlled fields for the protocol's built-in types (text, textarea, number, boolean, date, datetime, time, select, email, url, color, slug, localized values, group, repeater with typed blocks, relation), one subpath per field. Each subpath also exports the registry entry of its type; `builtInFields` and `fieldsPlugin` gather them, and `FieldsProvider` gives nested fields their components, locales, relation source and a binding to a store by path. `createRelationSource()` searches any adapter with a `list()` method, such as `@panneau/data`'s. `richtext` and `media` render a placeholder until their plugins exist.

### Minor Changes

- 8d1313a: The messages of `@panneau/ui`, `@panneau/fields` and `@panneau/forms` now live in `@panneau/intl`. `@panneau/ui/locales`, `@panneau/fields/locales` and `@panneau/forms/locales` still export the `en` and `fr` messages of their package, but are deprecated: use `withPanneauMessages()`, `en` or `fr` from `@panneau/intl`, which have the messages of every package. `fieldsPlugin` now carries the French messages of every package, those of `@panneau/forms` included.
- 9c844ee: Relation fields show the labels of values that are only ids (`"12"`), and can create items from the picker. `RelationSource` has two optional methods: `resolve(resource, ids)`, which gives the references of ids (fields that show the same ids share one request), and `create(resource, text)`, with `canCreate(resource)`, which the picker offers as "Create “…”". `createRelationSource()` resolves ids with the adapter's `get()`, and creates items with its `create()` when given `create: true` (the text becomes the `itemTitle`, in every locale when it is localized) or a function that gives the values. `RelationField` takes `onCreate`, which can open a dialog and resolves with the new reference. `useRelationReferences()` resolves references for other components. In `@panneau/lists`, relation filters resolve the labels of ids that come from the URL, for their chips and picker. `@panneau/intl` has the new messages, in English and French.

### Patch Changes

- 2565d67: Add `@panneau/protocol/runtime`: the constants of the protocol and the helpers that run in the browser (`checkValues()`, `checkRules()`, `evaluateCondition()`, `lintDefinition()`, `getValue()`, `isFilled()`, `isProblem()`, `toSearchParams()`, `fromSearchParams()`), without loading zod. The main entry point still exports everything. `isProblem()` no longer uses the `Problem` schema, and accepts the same values. `@panneau/core` and `@panneau/fields` import the helpers from there, so zod (about 360 KB of source) is no longer in the bundles of products that use the forms and lists.
