Dry runs of actions, so that a list can say how many items of a query selection ("Select all N items") an action will skip before the user confirms it. In the protocol, an action declares `dryRun`, and a request with `"dryRun": true` answers an action result without running anything; the mock backend answers them, and the conformance kit checks them (`action.dry-run`). `@panneau/actions` adds `useActionPreview()` and `previewAction()`, and `ListView` takes a `previewAction`: its confirmation shows that it is checking, then the backend's count, and runs at once when nothing is skipped and the action asks no confirmation.
