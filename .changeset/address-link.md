Addresses and links ([decisions 0054](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0054-addresses.md) and [0055](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0055-links.md)).

- **`address`:** a new built-in type, the parts of a postal address, `{ street, unit, city, region, postalCode, country }`, with a `point` when `settings.point` is on. `AddressField` (`@panneau/fields/address`) shows the country first, which sets the labels (_Province_, _State_, _ZIP code_), the order and the regions of the other parts, normalizes the postal code of Canada and the United States when it loses focus (`H2X 1Y4`), fills every part with a place found by the address search of the `FieldsProvider`'s maps, and places the address on a map with `point`. Settings: `country`, `countries`, `preferred`, `required` (the parts a filled address must have, `street`, `city` and `country` by default) and `point`. Lists show the address on one line, with the flag of its country.
- **`link`:** a new built-in type, `{ type, url, page, file, label, newTab }`, to a URL, a page (an item of the field's `resource`, searched in each of them), an email address (`mailto:`), a phone number (`tel:`), a media (with the media plugin), or a type that the site adds in `settings.types`, with a label per locale and a new tab chosen, set by the type (`newTab: external`) or never. `LinkField` is in `@panneau/fields/link`. Lists show the label, linked to the URL.
- **The `postalCode` rule** is a new portable rule: a postal code of its country, given as a code or another field (`{ "field": "country" }`), for Canada and the United States. `normalizePostalCode()` and `isPostalCode()` are in `@panneau/protocol`, with `getLinkTypes()` and `resolveLinkNewTab()`.
- `checkValues()` checks the parts of addresses and links, and keys their failures by the path of each part (`venue.postalCode`, `cta.url`); forms show them under the input of the part. The schemas `AddressValue`, `LinkValue`, `AddressSettings` and `LinkSettings` describe them, and `validateDefinition()` checks the settings.
- The conformance kit checks that a backend refuses an invalid postal code or link at the path of the part (`update.parts`), on a resource with an `address` or a `link` field.
- `GeocodingResult` has the parts of an `address`, which `createNominatimSource()` now asks for.
