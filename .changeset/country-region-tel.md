Countries, regions and phone numbers ([decision 0042](https://github.com/folkloreinc/panneau-js/blob/v5.x/docs/decisions/0042-countries-regions-and-phone-numbers.md)).

- **`country`:** a new built-in type, an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (`CA`). `CountryField` (`@panneau/fields/country`) picks it by name in the user's locale, with its flag; `settings.countries` limits the choices and `settings.preferred` puts some first. Lists show the flag and the name.
- **`region`:** a new built-in type, a state, a province or a territory of the country in the field that `from` names, or of `settings.country`. `RegionField` (`@panneau/fields/region`) picks among the regions of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States, named in English or French, and gives the code without the country (`QC`); for other countries, it is a text. Lists show the name.
- **`tel` values are now E.164** (`+15145550199`). **Breaking:** the new `tel` rule, implied by the type, refuses numbers kept as typed. `TelField` shows the country of the number, its flag and its calling code in a menu at the start of the input, formats the number as it is typed, follows a number typed with its calling code, and turns a number as typed into E.164 when the field is left. `settings.country` (`country`) is the country of a new number. Lists show the flag and the international format.
- `@panneau/ui`: options of `Select` and items of `ComboBox` take a decorative `prefix`; `ComboBox` takes a `prefix` before its input; `Select` takes `renderValue` and `appearance="bare"`, to sit inside another control.
- `@panneau/fields` depends on `libphonenumber-js`.
