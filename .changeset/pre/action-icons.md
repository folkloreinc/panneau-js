Icons by name. `getNamedIcon(name)` of `@panneau/ui` turns a Lucide icon name (`"send"`) into an icon component, which loads that icon the first time it renders (one dynamic import per icon), with an empty space of the same size until then. `loadNamedIcon(name)` loads one ahead of time. `@panneau/lists` shows the icon an action names (`"icon": "send"`), and takes icon components by action id for actions written in code (`actionIcons={{ archive: Archive }}` on `ListView` and `List`), which win over names. `getActionIcon()` and `ActionIcons` are exported.
