'@panneau/core': minor
'@panneau/forms': patch
---

Add pure selectors of a form state to `@panneau/core`: `selectValue(state, path)`, `selectErrors(state, path, { nested })`, `selectErrorCount(state, paths)` and `selectVisible(state, target, parentPath)`. Components read the state they subscribed to with them. The form's reading methods (`getValue()`, `getErrors()`, `countErrors()`, `isVisible()`) are now documented as non-React APIs: the React Compiler memoizes their calls by their arguments, so they return stale results in components. `@panneau/forms` uses the selectors of `@panneau/core` instead of its own.
