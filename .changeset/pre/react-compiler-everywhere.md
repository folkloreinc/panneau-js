Every component is memoized by the React Compiler again. The packages were built with Babel 8, on which React Compiler 1.0 skips any component with a default value in its props (`Fieldset`, `Text`, `TextInput` and most others), so they shipped without memoization. The build is back on Babel 7, and the components the compiler still skipped (`Panneau`, `FormView`, `ListView`, `Select`, the file, location, embed, slug and relation fields, `MediaField`, `MediaPicker` and `ImageEditor`) are rewritten so that it compiles them. Nothing changes in their behavior.
